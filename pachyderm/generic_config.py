    So if there are three iterables, a, b, and c, if we selected c, then we iterate over a and b,
    and return c in the same order each time for each set of values of a and b. As an example, consider
    the set of iterables:

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> a = ["a1", "a2"]
        >>> b = ["b1", "b2"]
        >>> c = ["c1", "c2"]

    then it will effectively return:

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> for a_val in a:
        ...     for b_val in b:
        ...         for c_val in c:
        ...             obj(a_val, b_val, c_val)

    This will yield:

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> output = list(iterate_with_selected_objects_in_order(..., selection = ["a"]))
        [[("a1", "b1", "c1"), ("a2", "b1", "c1")], [("a1", "b2", "c1"), ("a2", "b2", "c1")], ...]

    This is particularly nice because we can then select on a set of iterables to be returned without
    having to specify the rest of the iterables that we don't really care about.

        analysis_objects: Analysis objects dictionary.
