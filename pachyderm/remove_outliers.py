    When the moving average falls below the limit, we consider the outliers to have begun.

    To determine the location of outliers:

    - Calculate the moving average for number_of_values_to_search_ahead values.
    - First, the moving average must go above the limit at least once to guard against a random cut
      in a low pt bin causing most of the data to be cut out.
    - Next, we look for a consecutive number of entries below limit_of_number_of_values_below_threshold.
    - If we meet that condition, we have found the index where the outliers begin. We then return the ROOT
      bin index of the value.
    - If not, we return -1.

    Note:
        The index returned is when the moving average first drops below the threshold for a moving average
        calculated with that bin at the center. This is somewhat different from a standard moving average
        calculation which would only look forward in the array.
